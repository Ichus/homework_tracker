README Homework Tracker
-----------------------

This app will eventually track the homework of a user. Displaying assignments
, allowing the user to submit assignments and highlighting assignments that
are past due.

Assignments are created by a teacher. Who will eventually be able to monitor the
progress of students.

Alot of work is left to be done as I was rather sick this weekend, and slept 50
hours Fri-Sun.

To Add
-----------------------
- Page for teachers to add users. I think I must change my has_and_belongs_to_many
relationship to a has_many :through relationship before I can do this.

- Then I can display a user's homework to the user

- Finish adding ability to render assignment descriptions in markdown.

- Remove pages that are only for testing

- Make the site prettier

- Add additional pages for more in-depth view of assignments and statistics
  individual and overall(different stats shown to users and teachers)

- Improve site navigation
